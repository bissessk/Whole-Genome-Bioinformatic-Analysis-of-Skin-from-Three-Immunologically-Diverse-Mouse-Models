# Whole-Genome-Bioinformatic-Analysis-of-Skin-from-Three-Immunologically-Diverse-Mouse-Models
Performed a differential gene expression analysis with RNA-seq on three immunologically diverse mouse models. Differentially expressed genes were identified and a GO term enrichment analysis was done to determine their roles.
